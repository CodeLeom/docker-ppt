# Run Puppeteer in a Docker environment

After cloning this repo, 
- To build the Puppeteer Docker image, start the `docker` desktop application (if you don't have it installed, you have to install it). You can now use the terminal of your code editor to run this `docker build -t docker-ppt .` command. The `docker-ppt` can have any name of your choice. After a successful build, you can now run the image.
- To run the image, in the code editor terminal, run `docker run docker-ppt` command.

You are good to go.
